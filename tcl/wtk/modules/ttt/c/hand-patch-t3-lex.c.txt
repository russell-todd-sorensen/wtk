Flex/bison makes a mistake and does not include the "find_rule" label
under this condition: usage of trailing context.

Another reason to get rid of this in __FLT_EVAL_METHOD_TS_18661_3__

Correct code goes like this:




		yy_current_state = *--(yy_state_ptr);
		(yy_lp) = yy_accept[yy_current_state];
find_rule: /* we branch to this label when backing up */
		for ( ; ; ) /* until we find what rule we matched */
			{
